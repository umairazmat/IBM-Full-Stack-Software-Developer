Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment—making it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.

DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated —quickly and reliably. 

Application Modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.
